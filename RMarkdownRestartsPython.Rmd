```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
 
RMarkdown retains variables between code snippets with R but not with Python.  

Let's first try it in R:  

```{r r1}
r1 <- 1
```
```{r r2}
print(r1)
```

Now let's try it in Python:  

```{python p1}
p1 <- 1
```

I commented out "print(p1)" in the following snippet, because it generated an error, copied below.  
```{python p2}
#print(p1)

```

x Line 26: Error in py_run_string_impl(code, local, convert) : NameError: name 'p1' is not defined Detailed traceback: File "<string>", line 1, in <module> calls:<Anonymous> ... py_capture_output -> force -> py_run_string -> py_run_string_impl Execution halted
