# radioMonitor1.py 
Monitor radio broadcast quality

A [Python package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) containing a function to create a series of *.wav files of a specified length (10 minutes in production) with name indicating the audio source (90_1FM for KKFI) and the time stamp started and ending on even multiples of the specified length.  Production and testing will be documented further in an R Markdown Document "radioMonitor1.Rmd".
