This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook obtaining "dir()" and tabling the first character.  

NOTE:  The "editor toolbar" (on the line below the filename) contains "Preview" in an "R Markdown Notebook" and "Knit" in an "R Markdown Document".  

First get the directory:  
```{r dir}
(Dir <- dir())
```

Now table the first character:  
```{r sort}
table(substring(Dir, 1, 1))
```
Done.  
```
